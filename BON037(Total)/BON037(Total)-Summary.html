                                <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - November 2024</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>9 of 11 sectors finished in positive territory, led by information technology up 10% and utilities up 9%. Materials and Energy remained in the red.</li>
                                    <li>Among factor indices, Momentum and Quality delivered the strongest performance, while Equal Weight and High Dividend underperformed.</li>
                                    <li>The ASX200 lifted 3.79% in November bolstered primarily by financials - due to the proportionality of financials in the index, typically 30%. </li>
                                    <li>The S&P 500 posted its largest gain of the year, rising 6%, driven by positive market sentiment and optimism about the economic outlook.</li>
                                    <li>US Mid-Cap Small-Cap indices soared, up 8.81% and 10.94%, highlighting the broadening of the market rally, despite uncertainty over tarrifs and Fed rate cuts. </li>
                                    <li>Consumer Discretionary and Financials were the top performing sectors up 13% and 10% for the month, with all sectors finishing in the green for the month. </li>
                                    <li>The Bank of England reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 4.75% in an 8-1 vote, and raised inflation projections for 2025 and 2026 after October's UK budget.</li>
                                    <li>Despite persistent inflation, investors anticipate that weak demand in France and Germany will provide the European Central Bank with sufficient grounds for additional rate cuts.</li>
                                    <li>The CSI300 marginally lifted but remained mostly flat in November, following a strong end to September. Chinese equities were buoyed by hopes of further stimulus, but hindered by a property crisis and trade tensions. </li>
                                    <li>Strong corporate earnings kept US high-yield spreads narrow, leading the asset class to outperform government bonds in November.</li>
                                    <li>The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.50%-4.75%. Going forward, US rate cut expectations fell to three cuts in the next 12 months. </li>
                                    <li>For global bonds, the strength of the USD in November impacted returns, as currency depreciation relative to the USD reduces the value of foreign bond returns when measured in USD.</li>
                                    <li>Commodity markets exhibited mixed performances. Gold prices declined by approximately 4% from their late October peak, influenced by a strengthening U.S. dollar and rising yields, which reduced the appeal of safe-haven assets. Conversely, iron ore prices rose above $102/tonne, driven by a 9.5% increase in China's steel production over the past three weeks, but in general has continued to decline from its 2021 highs of $213/tonne. Meanwhile, lithium prices continued to decline, reflecting weaker-than-expected demand for electric vehicles and an oversupply in the market.</li>
